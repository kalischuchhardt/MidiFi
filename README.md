# MidiFi
Welcome to MidiFi! The MidiFile Piano Song Rank and Sorter. 

This is intended for individuals who want to learn how to play piano, but do not know which songs to start according to their difficulty level. Our program reads and parses through a database of classical piano midifiles and ranks them based off of tempo and distance between midi notes. Then our program maps these ranks to difficulty levels (Easy, Intermediate, Hard) and stores these midi songs in a min and max heap in order to sort them from highest rank in the difficulty level to lowest and vice versa.

In order to use our repository, clone our repository and make sure you use our CMakeLists.txt. This is to ensure that the MidiFile and SFML libraries are included in the project.

In order to have the best experience, make the MidiFi app full screen and turn your volume on!

Enjoy!
